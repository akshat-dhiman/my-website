    <h4>From Akshat Dhiman :)</h4>
<h2 style="color:#fe0000;">My Anime Life</h2>
<hr>
<div class="meabout">
<p>So it all began back when I was in 8th standard. I was a quiet and introverted guy who used to speak with only
  one or two other guys and they were kinda friends to me. Staying quiet all the time, listening to lectures, studying
  and getting lost in my own imagination of cartoons used to take most of my day. I was a boring guy whose only interest
  was in cartoons which I used to watch in my good old days.
  Most common types coming those days were <b style="color:#fe0000;">Shinchan, Doraemon, Ben 10</b> and blah blah...
  But the ones which took most of my interest were <b style="color:#fe0000;">Idaten Jump, Zatchbell and Pokemon.</b>
  Man, I loved them a lot and always used to draw those characters.</p>
  <p>Later, in 11th standard a new show named <b style="color:#fe0000;">Dragonball Z</b> started airing on Toonami channel.
    I started watching this show everyday for half an hour and later I realized that I had been addicted to this show. I
    started searching about it on the internet and found many sources which show cartoons like this..<i style="color:#fe0000;">(yeah, Dragonball Z
    was a cartoon for me back then.xD)</i>. I found a black and white book filled with dbz characters and the dbz story. As
    I started reading it, I got addicted to it too.. and later realized that this thing is known as <b style="color:#fe0000;">Manga</b> and it's
    Anime that I am watching not a cartoon. After I finished it, I was kinda feeling depressed that I have nothing to watch now..so I started my research
    and found that this show has a different backstory too. Then I started watching the backstory but the strict schedule was still
    the same, half an hour per day. I used to search a lot about Anime and found it very interesting. But then came the
      12th standard and I had to leave all this cause I was preparing for jee.</p>
    <p>After I finished my 12th and all the entrance exams I was introduced to a guy in SRM who's bigger fan of Anime than me..
    He introduced me to many good Anime that I never heard of..<i style="color:#fe0000;">(Anime is all it takes for Otakus to be friends :D)</i>
    I started watching a lot of Anime in my free time and finished series one by one. I found that I am addicted to this thing and not even a single day of mine goes
    without watching Anime. I have covered a lot of series till now and I have learned a lot from them.</p>
    <p>Along with the dose of entertainment, Anime is also something which teaches me a lot about Life. <i style="color:#fe0000;">Yahari Ore no Sheishun Love Comedy</i> is a must watch for you all. Each and every episode of every single Anime tells you something deep.
       The lessons I get from Anime are very deep and not something simple like Hardwork is the key to success and blah blah..
      Whenever I watch an anime I connect myself to it's story & when I finish it I feel kinda sad that I can no longer be a part of this journey.
      Anime stories are very deep and the best. Perhaps I can say that Anime is the best thing I've seen and experienced in my life.
      I still am amazed that how japanese people can create so good stories in each and every single Anime. It's like they have this
      thing in their mind <b style="color:#fe0000;">'The best or nothing'</b>. I love their creativity in Anime. I wish to go to <b style="color:#fe0000;">Japan</b> one day and explore
      it's rich heritage and meet my favourite anime authors if possible ;).
    <h4 style="font-weight:bold;color:#fe0000;text-align:center;">We Otakus are comfortable being 'weird'.</h4>

           <div class="series">
             <p>Goku now works as a farmer to support his family. A new threat <b style="color:#fe0000;">Beerus</b> the <i style="color:#fe0000;">destruction god of Universe 7</i> appears.  After awakening from decades of slumber, Beerus tells <b style="color:#fe0000;">Whis</b>, his attendant, that he is eager to fight the legendary warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy known as the <b style="color:#fe0000;">Super Saiyan God</b>.
               To protect Earth, Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God to fight Beerus by using the power of five Super Saiyans, which includes <i style="color:#fe0000;">Vegeta, Gohan, Son Goten, Trunks,</i> and the baby in <b style="color:#fe0000;">Videl's</b> womb.
               Despite losing, Goku's efforts appease the God of Destruction enough that he decides to spare the planet.
               While Goku and Vegeta leave with Beerus and Whis to train for a year, the remaining remnants of Frieza's army arrive on Earth in search for the Dragon Balls to revive <b style="color:#fe0000;">Frieza</b>. Frieza gets revived and achieves a new form
               <b style="color:#fe0000;">Golden Frieza</b> who comes to earth to take revenge from Goku but gets defeated by Goku and Vegeta with the help of reversing time technique that Whis posses.
               <b style="color:#fe0000;">Champa</b>, Beerus's brother and <i style="color:#fe0000;">God of Destruction of Universe 6</i> challenges Beerus to a tournament between both Universe strongest fighters.
               Each match in the tournament shows different surprises and abilities. Most interesting part comes during the fight between Goku and <b style="color:#fe0000;">Hit</b>, when Goku beats the <i style="color:#fe0000;">time lapse technique</i> of Hit and goes <b style="color:#fe0000;">Super Saiyan Blue with 100X Kioken</b>. Goku forfeits the match to make Hit fight with his full strength.
               The heavy form makes a toll of Goku's body. Hit gets inspired from Goku to work even more harder.
                Later, <b style="color:#fe0000;">Future Trunks</b> reappears and brings news of a new and powerful enemy resembling Goku, who is known as <b style="color:#fe0000;">Goku Black</b>. Goku and Vegeta go in future to challenge him but return back defeated. They find that this fake Goku is <b style="color:#fe0000;">Supreme Kai</b> apprentice from the 10th Universe named <b style="color:#fe0000;">Zamasu</b>.
                He planed to wipe out all mortals but was defeated by Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks in an epic battle.
                After that, the Grand Zeno holds a new tournament called <i style="color:#fe0000;">Tournament of Power</i> and includes all 10 universes in it. The losing ones will be erased.
                <i>Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Krillin, Android 17, Android 18, Piccolo, Tien, Master Roshi, and a temporarily revived Frieza</i> join the tournament as representatives for the 7th Universe to protect it.
                 During the fight, Goku briefly attains a new <i>godly</i> form known as <b style="color:#fe0000;">Ultra Instinct</b>. This form improved his reflexes at the godly level and made him even more stronger whereas Vegeta achieves a dark blue form.
                  The tournament ends with Goku and Frieza taking <b style="color:#fe0000;">Jiren</b> down along with themselves, which leaves <b style="color:#fe0000;">Android 17</b> the sole contestant remaining and the winner of the Tournament of Power. They wish all erased universes
                  back to life. <b style="color:#fe0000;">Goku vs Kefla</b> & <b style="color:#fe0000;">Goku vs Jiren</b> were the most epic battles of the series.</p>
